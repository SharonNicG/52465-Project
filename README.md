# Programming for Data Analysis 52465-Project

## Project Description

The project requires creating a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon using Python and the numpy.random package. 
Full details available [here](ProgDAProject.pdf).

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out:
* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which at least one-hundred data points, across at least four different variables, can be collected
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible
* Detail the research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.


## Prerequisites for the Assignment
To complete the assignment, I installed the full Anaconda package from https://www.anaconda.com.

The packages are used in this repository (detailed below) are all part of the Anaconda package:

- Jupyter Notebook - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jupyter or https://jupyter.org/
- NumPy package - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy or https://numpy.org/
- Seaborn - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/seaborn or https://seaborn.pydata.org/
- Matplotlib - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/matplotlib or https://matplotlib.org/
- Pandas - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas or https://pandas.pydata.org/

## Running a Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter is a Python package and does not require importation from Python packages. It is commonly run from the machine command line.

To launch a Jupyter notebook, open your terminal/command line and navigate to the directory where you have saved the pulled jupyter notebook. By typing the command jupyter notebook into your terminal/command line, an instance of jupyter will be created on a local server.

When jupyter notebook has been called from your terminal/command line, a browser window should open showing the Jupyter Notebook interface. If it does not, you can copy the URL presented in the terminal/command line, and paste this into your browser's address bar.

Once you have accessed the Jupyter Notebook interface, you can view the files in the current directory. Clicking on the files will open them. Jupyter notebook files are identifiable by their notebook icon (within the Jupyter Notebook interface and by the file extension .ipynb

To close the notebook, terminate the browser tab by clicking the "X" in the top right corner. To stop the instance on the local server and shutdown the jupyter kernel, in the terminal/command line press control-C.

The above steps should allow for the jupyter notebook to display automatically (assuming the prerequisites have been met). Jupyter Notebooks can also be rendered by pasting the URL presented in the terminal/command line on the site https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
